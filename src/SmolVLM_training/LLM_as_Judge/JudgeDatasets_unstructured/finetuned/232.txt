 The pie chart illustrates the public opinion on the U.S. involvement in Iraq, specifically regarding the responsibility for the violence in Iraq. The survey was conducted from July 8 to July 14, 2014, and the figures may not add up to 100% due to rounding.

The majority of respondents (55%) believe that the U.S. does not have a responsibility to do something about the violence in Iraq. This is followed by 39% who think the U.S. has a responsibility but does not have the authority to do so. A smaller portion (6%) do not know.

On the other hand, only 39% of respondents believe that the U.S. does have a responsibility to address the violence in Iraq. This is further supported by the fact that 55% of respondents believe the U.S. does not have a responsibility to do something about the violence in Iraq.

Overall, the data suggests that a significant portion of the public believes that the U.S. does not have a responsibility to do something about the violence in Iraq. Conversely, a smaller but notable number of respondents believe that the U.S. does have a responsibility but does not have the authority to do so. A small percentage of respondents do not know.

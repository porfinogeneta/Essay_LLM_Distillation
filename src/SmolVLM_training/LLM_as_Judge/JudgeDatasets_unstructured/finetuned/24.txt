 The pie chart illustrates the public opinion on the impact of greater U.S. involvement in the global economy. The data is based on a survey conducted in 2013, with a sample size of 41.

The majority of respondents, 66%, believe that greater U.S. involvement in the global economy is a good thing because it exposes the U.S. to new markets and opportunities for growth. This sentiment is shared by 25% of the respondents, who view it as a bad thing because it exposes the U.S. to greater economic risks and uncertainty.

A small percentage of respondents, 8%, do not have a clear opinion on the matter, while 8% are unsure about the impact of greater U.S. involvement in the global economy.

Overall, the data suggests that a significant majority of the public views greater U.S. involvement in the global economy as a positive development, with only a small minority expressing concern about the potential risks and uncertainties.

 The bar chart illustrates the average number of days waiting for gallstone surgery on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2010 to 2015.

The data reveals a steady increase in the average waiting time for gallstone surgery over the five-year period. In 2010, the average waiting time was 73.2 days, which rose to 80.6 days in 2011. This upward trend continued, with the average waiting time reaching 73.8 days in 2012 and 73.1 days in 2013.

However, the waiting time experienced a slight decline in 2014, dropping to 90.7 days. This improvement was followed by a further increase in 2015, with the average waiting time reaching 89.9 days.

Overall, the data indicates a consistent increase in the average waiting time for gallstone surgery on the NHS from 2010 to 2015. The most significant increase occurred between 2010 and 2011, with the waiting time rising by approximately 1.4 days. Conversely, the waiting time decreased by 1.4 days between 2014 and 2015, suggesting a potential improvement in the system.

Despite the overall increase, the waiting time for gallstone surgery on the NHS remained relatively high, with an average of 89.9 days in 2015. This indicates that despite the improvements, there is still room for further enhancement in the system to reduce waiting times.

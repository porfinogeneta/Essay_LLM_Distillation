 The chart illustrates the total size of the U.S. active-duty force from 1990 to 2015, with a focus on the size of the active-duty force. The data is presented in millions, with a linear scale from 1.2 to 2.1 on the y-axis, marked "Total size of USS active-duty force."

The data reveals a significant decline in the size of the active-duty force over the period. In 1990, the active-duty force stood at approximately 2.2 million, which gradually decreased to 1.3 million by 2015. This decline is particularly noticeable between 1995 and 2000, where the force size dropped from 2.0 million to 1.4 million.

The most notable decrease occurred between 1995 and 2000, where the force size dropped by over 0.5 million, from 2.0 million to 1.5 million. This sharp decline suggests a potential shift in military strategy or resource allocation during this period.

Overall, the data indicates a consistent decrease in the size of the active-duty force over the 25-year period, with the most significant reductions occurring between 1995 and 2000. This trend highlights the potential impact of military changes and resource management on the size of the active-duty force.

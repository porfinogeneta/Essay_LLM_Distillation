 The chart illustrates the percentage of U.S. adults who identify as Christians and religious 'nones' (those who do not identify with any religion) from 2007 to 2019, based on aggregated Pew Research Center political surveys.

The data reveals a significant decline in the percentage of adults identifying as Christians over the years. In 2007, 78% of adults identified as Christians, but this figure decreased to 65% in 2019. Conversely, the percentage of adults identifying as religiously unaffiliated has increased from 16% in 2007 to 26% in 2019.

The chart also highlights the growth of religious 'nones' in the U.S. population. The percentage of adults identifying as religiously unaffiliated has risen from 16% in 2007 to 26% in 2019. This trend indicates a shift away from traditional religious affiliations and towards more secular or non-religious identities.

Overall, the data suggests a decline in the percentage of adults identifying as Christians in the U.S. while the number of religiously unaffiliated individuals has increased. This trend reflects a broader shift in religious identity and beliefs in the country.

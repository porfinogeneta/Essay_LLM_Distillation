 The bar chart illustrates the Gini coefficient of after-tax income in Canada from 2000 to 2018. The Gini coefficient is a measure of income inequality, with a value of 0 indicating perfect equality and 1 indicating perfect inequality.

The data reveals a relatively stable trend in the Gini coefficient over the period. Starting at 0.32 in 2000, the coefficient gradually increased to 0.33 in 2001 and remained relatively stable until 2005. From 2005 to 2008, the Gini coefficient experienced a slight decline, reaching 0.31 in 2008. Subsequently, it rose again, peaking at 0.33 in 2010.

From 2010 to 2018, the Gini coefficient stabilized at around 0.33, indicating a slight decline in income inequality. The most significant decline occurred between 2000 and 2001, with a decrease of 0.01. The most notable increase occurred between 2005 and 2008, with a rise of 0.02. Overall, the data suggests a slight increase in income inequality over the period, with a notable decline in the early 2000s and a subsequent increase in the mid-2000s.

In conclusion, the Gini coefficient of after-tax income in Canada has fluctuated over the period, with a general upward trend from 2000 to 2010, followed by a slight decline and stabilization from 2010 to 2018. The most significant increase occurred between 2005 and 2008, while the most notable decline occurred between 2000 and 2001. Overall, the data indicates a slight increase in income inequality over the period.

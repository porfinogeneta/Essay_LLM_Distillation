 The pie chart illustrates the responses to the question "Would You Move to the U.S.?" based on a survey conducted by Pew Research Center. The data is divided into three categories: No, Yes - w/o authorization, and Yes - with authorization.

The majority of respondents, 61%, indicated that they would not move to the U.S. This is followed by those who would move with authorization, 20%, and those who would move without authorization, 18%. The smallest proportion of respondents, 2%, indicated that they would not move to the U.S., and 2% also indicated that they would not move.

The data suggests that a significant majority of respondents are hesitant to move to the U.S., with a substantial portion indicating they would not move without authorization. Conversely, a smaller but notable number of respondents would move with authorization, indicating a willingness to relocate.

Overall, the data highlights a clear trend of reluctance among respondents to move to the U.S., with a majority choosing not to move without authorization. The smaller proportion of those willing to move with authorization suggests a potential gap in understanding or access to legal pathways to immigration.

This data can be valuable for policymakers and researchers interested in understanding the attitudes and motivations of individuals considering immigration to the U.S. It also underscores the need for effective immigration policies and programs that address the concerns of potential immigrants.

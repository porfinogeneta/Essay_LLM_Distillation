 The chart illustrates the percentage of the population in the United States who identify as having Irish ancestry, by state. The data is based on the 2011-2015 5-year estimates from the Census Bureau.

The chart reveals that the Northeast states, particularly Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, have the highest percentages of people with Irish ancestry. Massachusetts has the highest percentage at 21.6%, followed by New Hampshire at 21.0%. Rhode Island comes in third with 18.3%.

In contrast, the states with the lowest percentages of Irish ancestry are West Virginia, New Jersey, and New York, with 14.6%, 14.3%, and 14.3%, respectively.

Overall, the data indicates that the Northeast states have the highest proportion of people with Irish ancestry, while the South and West have the lowest. This trend suggests a historical concentration of Irish immigration in these regions, potentially influenced by factors such as economic opportunities and historical events.

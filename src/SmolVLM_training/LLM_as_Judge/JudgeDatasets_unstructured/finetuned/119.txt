 The chart illustrates the number of unauthorized immigrants removed from the United States from fiscal year 2000 to 2018. The data reveals a significant increase in removals from fiscal year 2000 to 2008, peaking at 432,281 in 2008. Following this peak, removals declined, reaching a low of 337,287 in fiscal year 2016. However, removals have rebounded since then, with a notable rise in 2018, reaching 337,287.

Overall, the data indicates a trend of increasing removals of unauthorized immigrants from fiscal year 2000 to 2008, followed by a decline and subsequent recovery. The most significant increase occurred between fiscal years 2000 and 2008, with removals peaking at 432,281 in 2008. Following this peak, removals declined, but have since rebounded, reaching 337,287 in fiscal year 2018.

The data also highlights the impact of the Trump administration's immigration policies, which included increased enforcement efforts and the implementation of the "Remain in Mexico" policy. These policies are likely to have contributed to the decline in removals in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. However, the recent increase in removals suggests that these policies may have had a less significant impact on the overall trend.

In conclusion, the data shows a fluctuating trend in removals of unauthorized immigrants from fiscal year 2000 to 2018. The most significant increases occurred between fiscal years 2000 and 2008, followed by a decline and subsequent recovery. The recent increase in removals suggests that the Trump administration's immigration policies may have had a less significant impact on the overall trend.

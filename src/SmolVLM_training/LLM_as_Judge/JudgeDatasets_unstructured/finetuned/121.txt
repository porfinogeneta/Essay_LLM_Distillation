 The chart illustrates the percentage of Catholics who rely on different sources for moral guidance, specifically focusing on those who consider "a great deal" or "a great deal" for guidance on difficult moral questions.

The data reveals that the majority of Catholics (73%) rely on their own conscience as a primary source of moral guidance. This is followed by Catholic Church teachings, with 21% of Catholics relying on these teachings. The Bible is cited by 15% of Catholics, while the Pope is cited by only 11%.

Interestingly, the data shows that a relatively small percentage of Catholics (11%) rely on the Pope for moral guidance. This is significantly lower compared to the reliance on their own conscience and Catholic Church teachings.

Overall, the data indicates that while a significant portion of Catholics rely on their own conscience and Catholic Church teachings, the Pope is a less frequently cited source of moral guidance. This suggests that personal reflection and religious teachings are more prevalent sources of moral guidance for Catholics, while the Pope's role is less central.

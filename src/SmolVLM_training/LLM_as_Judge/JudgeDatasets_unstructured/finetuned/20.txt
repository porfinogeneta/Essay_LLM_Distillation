 The bar chart illustrates the average length of stay for U.S. students studying abroad in 2018/19, categorized by the length of their stay.

The data reveals that the majority of U.S. students studying abroad in 2018/19 stayed for a short-term period, with 64.9% staying for 8 weeks or less. This indicates a strong preference for shorter stays, possibly driven by factors such as budget constraints, time limitations, or the desire to explore a specific region or country.

Mid-length stays, ranging from 1 to 2 terms per semester, accounted for 32.9% of the students. This segment reflects a more moderate approach, where students may choose to spend a longer period to fully immerse themselves in the study environment.

A small percentage of students, 2.2%, stayed for a long-term period of 1 year or more. This segment highlights the relatively small number of students who opted for a more extended stay, possibly due to factors such as longer-term research projects, internships, or longer-term study abroad programs.

Overall, the data indicates that the majority of U.S. students studying abroad in 2018/19 opted for short-term stays, with a significant minority choosing mid-length stays. The data suggests that students are primarily focused on shorter stays, possibly driven by financial constraints and time limitations. However, a small but notable number of students chose longer-term stays, indicating a preference for more extended stays for certain purposes.

 The chart illustrates the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests in the United States from 2009 to 2017, broken down by fiscal year.

The data reveals a significant increase in ICE arrests in 2017, with a total of 143,470 arrests. This is a substantial rise from the previous year, where there were 110,104 arrests. The increase in 2017 is the highest recorded in the past decade, indicating a notable rise in enforcement efforts.

In comparison, the number of ICE arrests in 2009 was 297,898, which is the highest recorded in the first decade of the 21st century. The subsequent years saw a gradual decline, with 2011 recording 291,000 arrests and 2013 recording 285,000 arrests. However, the 2017 figures show a sharp increase, indicating a renewed focus on immigration enforcement.

Overall, the data suggests a significant rise in ICE arrests in 2017, with the highest recorded number in the past decade. This rise is particularly notable given the historical decline in arrests from 2009 to 2013. The increase in 2017 is a clear indicator of a renewed focus on immigration enforcement by ICE.

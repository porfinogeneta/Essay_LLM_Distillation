 The pie chart illustrates the public opinion on U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola virus in West Africa, specifically in the countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The survey was conducted from October 15-20, 2014.

The data reveals that a significant majority of respondents (77%) favored U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola virus in West Africa. This strong support is likely due to the global concern and the need for international cooperation in addressing the crisis.

On the other hand, 19% of respondents opposed U.S. efforts, indicating a minority opposition. The remaining 3% of respondents either did not know or refused to answer the question, which is a small proportion.

Overall, the data suggests a clear majority in favor of U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola virus in West Africa, with only a small minority opposed. The overwhelming support highlights the public's desire for international collaboration and assistance in addressing the crisis.

 The chart illustrates the percentage of German men and women who view the United States as a reliable ally, broken down by age group and political affiliation.

Overall, the data reveals that a majority of both men and women in Germany hold a positive view of the U.S. as a reliable ally, with 62% of the total population and 68% of men expressing this sentiment.

Looking at the data by age group, there is a noticeable decline in the percentage of those who view the U.S. as a reliable ally as individuals age. For instance, only 58% of individuals aged 18-29 hold this view, compared to 63% of those aged 30-49 and 66% of those aged 50-64. This trend suggests that younger generations may be less likely to perceive the U.S. as a reliable ally than older generations.

Furthermore, the data also highlights a significant difference in opinion between SPD adherents and CDU/CSU adherents. While 74% of SPD adherents view the U.S. as a reliable ally, this figure drops to 66% for CDU/CSU adherents. This disparity indicates that SPD supporters are more likely to perceive the U.S. as a reliable ally than CDU/CSU supporters.

In summary, the data indicates that a majority of both German men and women hold a positive view of the U.S. as a reliable ally, with the highest percentages among younger generations and SPD adherents. However, there is a decline in this perception as individuals age and among CDU/CSU adherents.

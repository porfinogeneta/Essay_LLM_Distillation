 The pie chart illustrates the percentage of U.S. adults who have ever spoken with or been interviewed by a local journalist, as of October 15-November 8, 2018.

The data reveals that a significant majority of U.S. adults (78%) have never spoken with or been interviewed by a local journalist. This statistic highlights the rarity of such interactions among the surveyed population.

In contrast, a smaller proportion (21%) of U.S. adults have engaged with a local journalist. This data indicates that while many individuals may have the opportunity to interact with local journalists, a substantial portion of the population has not done so.

The remaining 1% of respondents provided an answer, but it is unclear what this response represents. This small percentage suggests that even a very small number of individuals have had the opportunity to speak with or be interviewed by a local journalist.

Overall, the data indicates that most Americans have never spoken with or been interviewed by a local journalist, with only a small minority having such experiences. This trend underscores the rarity of journalistic interactions among the general population.

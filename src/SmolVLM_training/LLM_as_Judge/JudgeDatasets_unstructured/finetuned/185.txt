 The pie chart illustrates the public opinion on the prohibition of trans fats in restaurants, as of October 30, 2013, based on data from the Pew Research Center.

The data reveals that a significant majority of the respondents (52%) oppose the prohibition of trans fats in restaurants, while 44% favor it. A small percentage (4%) either do not know or have no opinion on the matter.

The data highlights a clear divide in public opinion, with a substantial majority opposing the ban on trans fats in restaurants. This opposition is particularly pronounced, with 52% of respondents favoring the status quo, compared to 44% who advocate for the prohibition.

The data suggests that there is a strong resistance to the ban on trans fats in restaurants, with a significant portion of the population believing that the current regulations are sufficient or even beneficial. This resistance may be driven by concerns about the economic impact of such a ban, potential changes in food quality, or a lack of awareness about the health risks associated with trans fats.

Overall, the data indicates a clear divide in public opinion regarding the prohibition of trans fats in restaurants. While a majority opposes the ban, a smaller but significant proportion favors it, and a very small percentage is unsure or indifferent.

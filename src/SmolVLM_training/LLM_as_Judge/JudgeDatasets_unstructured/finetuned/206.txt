 The chart illustrates the percentage of adults who grew up in rural, suburban, and urban areas, and the likelihood of having a gun in their household when they were growing up.

Overall, the data reveals that a significant majority of adults who grew up in rural areas (72%) reported having a gun in their household when they were growing up. This is significantly higher compared to those who grew up in suburban (52%) or urban areas (39%).

Specifically, 48% of all adults reported having a gun in their household when they were growing up, with rural areas having the highest percentage at 72%. In contrast, only 37% of adults who grew up in suburbs and 39% of those who grew up in cities reported having a gun in their household when they were growing up.

The data suggests that rural areas have a higher prevalence of gun ownership among children compared to suburban and urban areas. This could be attributed to various factors, including cultural norms, access to firearms, and historical contexts.

In summary, the data indicates that a majority of adults who grew up in rural areas have reported having a gun in their household when they were growing up, with rural areas having the highest percentage at 72%. This contrasts with suburban and urban areas, where the percentage is lower at 37% and 39%, respectively.

 The chart illustrates the percentage of adults from different generations who have shared a selfie, as of February 14-23, 2014.

Millennials, the youngest generation, are the most likely to have shared a selfie, with 55% of them doing so. Gen X follows closely, with 24% of them sharing selfies. Boomers, the oldest generation, are the least likely to have shared a selfie, with only 9% of them doing so. The Silent Generation, the oldest generation, is the least likely to have shared a selfie, with only 4% of them doing so.

Overall, the data shows that Millennials are significantly more likely to have shared a selfie compared to other generations. Gen X and Boomers are also more likely to have shared a selfie than the Silent Generation, but the difference is not as pronounced.

This data highlights the generational differences in the adoption of selfie culture. Millennials are at the forefront of this trend, while older generations are less likely to participate. This trend suggests that selfie culture is becoming increasingly popular among younger generations, while older generations may be less inclined to engage in this practice.

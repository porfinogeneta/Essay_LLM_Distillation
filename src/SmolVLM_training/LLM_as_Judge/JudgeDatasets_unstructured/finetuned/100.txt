 The chart illustrates the public perception of the United States in the context of international relations, specifically focusing on the opinions of the people in the Middle East. The data is based on a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2011.

The chart reveals that the majority of respondents in the Middle East have a favorable view of the United States, with 64% expressing a desire for improved relations with the U.S. This positive sentiment is particularly evident in countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, where the majority of respondents hold a favorable opinion.

However, there are also notable negative ratings for the U.S. in the region. In Egypt, 8% of respondents expressed a lack of confidence in the Obama administration, while in Jordan, 17% had a negative view of the U.S. These figures highlight the potential for political and social factors to influence public opinion.

Overall, the data suggests that while the majority of respondents in the Middle East desire improved relations with the U.S., there are also significant negative perceptions. The most common negative sentiment is a lack of confidence in the Obama administration, indicating a potential shift in public opinion or a response to recent political events.

 The chart illustrates the projected working-age population in the United States from 1965 to 2035, with and without future immigration.

Without future immigration, the working-age population is projected to decrease by 2035, from 183 million in 2015 to 166 million. This decline is attributed to the aging population and the absence of new immigration.

With future immigration, the working-age population is projected to increase by 2035, from 183 million in 2015 to 188 million. This increase is due to the influx of new immigrants, who contribute to the overall population growth.

The data highlights the significant impact of immigration on the working-age population in the United States. Without immigration, the working-age population is projected to decline, while with immigration, it is projected to increase. This data emphasizes the importance of immigration in maintaining a stable and growing working-age population in the country.

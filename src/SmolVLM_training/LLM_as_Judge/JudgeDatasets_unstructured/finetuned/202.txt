 The chart illustrates the percentage of U.S. adults who view drinking alcohol as morally wrong, categorized by religious affiliation and frequency of religious services.

White evangelical Protestants are the most likely to view alcohol as morally wrong, with 16% of their respondents considering it morally wrong. This is significantly higher than the percentage of White mainline Protestants (7%) and Black Protestants (13%).

Catholic and unaffiliated individuals also show a higher percentage of those who view alcohol as morally wrong, with 15% and 7% respectively. Atheists and agnostics have the lowest percentages, with less than 1% and 5% respectively.

Interestingly, those who attend religious services monthly or less frequently are more likely to view alcohol as morally wrong. Among those who attend religious services monthly, 22% consider alcohol morally wrong, compared to 9% of those who attend less than monthly.

Overall, the data suggests that religious affiliation and frequency of religious services play a significant role in shaping attitudes towards alcohol consumption. White evangelical Protestants, Catholics, and unaffiliated individuals are more likely to view alcohol as morally wrong, while those who attend religious services less frequently or do not identify with any specific religion are less likely to hold this view.

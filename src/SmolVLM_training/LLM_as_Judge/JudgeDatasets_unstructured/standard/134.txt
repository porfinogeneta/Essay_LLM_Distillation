 A new survey finds that the public is divided over whether transgender people should be allowed to use the public restrooms of the gender they were born into. About half (51%) say transgender people should be allowed to use the public restrooms of the gender with which they currently identify, while 46% say they should be required to use the public restrooms of the gender they were born into.

 Immigration enforcement arrests by ICE have risen in recent years, with the number of arrests in fiscal year 2017 reaching 143,470, up from 110,104 in fiscal year 2015. The increase in arrests is due in part to a rise in arrests of unauthorized immigrants, who make up the majority of ICEâ€™s immigrant population. The number of arrests of unauthorized immigrants has increased by 12,374 since 2015.

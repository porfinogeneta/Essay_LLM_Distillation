 Rising prices, crime and the gap between rich and poor are the biggest concerns in Turkey, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.
The survey, conducted in March and April, found that 61% of Turks said rising prices were a very big problem in their country. Crime was cited by 57% of respondents, and the gap between rich and poor was cited by 55%.
The survey also found that Turks were more concerned about the gap between rich and poor than about the gap between the rich and the poor.

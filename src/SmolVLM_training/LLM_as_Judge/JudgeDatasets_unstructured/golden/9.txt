The first essay is better as it provides a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of the bar chart, discussing each attribute in detail and providing specific percentages. It also offers a conclusion that summarizes the overall positive image of Obama based on the data presented. The second essay, while accurate, is more concise and lacks the depth of analysis and summary provided in the first essay. Therefore, the answer is <FIRST>.

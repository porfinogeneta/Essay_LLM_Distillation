Total number of Bitcoin ATM installations in Belgium and the Netherlands as of June 2020 , by city

The bar chart illustrates the total number of Bitcoin ATM installations in various cities across Belgium and the Netherlands as of June 2020. The data is represented in terms of the number of ATMs installed in each city.

The chart reveals a significant disparity in the distribution of Bitcoin ATMs between the two countries. Amsterdam (NL) leads with a remarkable 22 installations, far surpassing other cities. Rotterdam (NL) follows with 7 ATMs, while Brussels (BE) and Antwerp (BE) have 5 and 4 installations respectively. Other cities such as Enschede (NL), Maastricht (NL), and Ghent (BE) have relatively fewer ATMs, ranging from 2 to 4 installations.

Smaller cities in both countries exhibit minimal installations, with most cities having only 1 Bitcoin ATM. These include Alkmaar (NL), Eindhoven (NL), Bastogne (BE), Kortrijk (BE), and several others. The data suggests a concentration of Bitcoin ATMs in larger, more populous cities, while smaller cities have yet to see significant adoption.

Overall, the data indicates a higher concentration of Bitcoin ATMs in the Netherlands compared to Belgium. Amsterdam stands out as the primary hub for Bitcoin ATMs, followed by Rotterdam. In Belgium, Brussels and Antwerp lead the way, but the overall numbers are lower. The distribution pattern suggests a correlation between city size and the number of Bitcoin ATMs, with larger cities having more installations.
The second essay is more accurate and resembles the golden standard essay more closely. It provides a comprehensive overview of the data presented in the bar chart, including the categorical scale and the specific cities with the highest and lowest number of installations. The first essay, while mentioning some correct data points, does not provide as detailed or accurate a description of the overall distribution and trends shown in the chart. Therefore, the answer is <SECOND>.

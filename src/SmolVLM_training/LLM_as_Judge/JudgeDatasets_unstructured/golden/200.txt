Value of the Dow Jones Composite Index from 2000 to 2020

The graph illustrates the changes in the population of India and China from 2000 to 2050, with projections extending to 2050.

In 2000, Chinas population was approximately 1.25 billion, and it experienced a steady increase until it reached its peak at around 1.45 billion in 2025. Following this peak, the population is expected to decline gradually, reaching approximately 1.4 billion by 2050.

In contrast, Indias population began at one billion in 2000 and has been rising consistently. It is projected to surpass Chinas population around 2030 and continue its upward trajectory, reaching an estimated 1.6 billion by 2050.

Overall, while Chinas population is anticipated to decline after 2030, Indias population is expected to continue growing, eventually overtaking China and reaching a higher peak by 2050.

The first essay is more accurate and detailed compared to the second one. The first essay provides a comprehensive analysis of the pie chart, including the context of the survey, the specific percentages, and the implications of the data. It also discusses the potential reasons for the uncertainty among respondents and emphasizes the importance of transparency in the electoral process. Therefore, the first essay is better suited for an IELTS exam and would likely receive a higher score. The answer is <FIRST>.

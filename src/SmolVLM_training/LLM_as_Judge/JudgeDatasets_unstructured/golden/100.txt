Negative Ratings for U.S., but Most Want Better Relations
The bar chart illustrates the negative ratings for the U.S. and the desire for improved relations, based on a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. The data is presented in three categories: confidence in Obama, favorable view of the U.S., and the desire for improved relations with the U.S.

The chart reveals a stark contrast between the confidence in Obama and the overall favorable view of the U.S. Only 8% of respondents expressed confidence in Obama, while a slightly higher 17% held a favorable view of the U.S. This indicates a significant disparity between the perception of the U.S. leadership and the country as a whole.

In stark contrast to the relatively low percentages of confidence and favorable views, a substantial 64% of respondents expressed a desire for improved relations with the U.S. This overwhelming majority highlights a strong inclination towards better diplomatic and international ties, despite the prevailing negative sentiments towards the U.S. leadership and overall image.

Overall, the data indicates a significant gap between the confidence in Obama and the favorable view of the U.S., with only 8% and 17% respectively. However, a remarkable 64% of respondents expressed a desire for improved relations with the U.S., suggesting a strong willingness to enhance international cooperation and diplomacy.

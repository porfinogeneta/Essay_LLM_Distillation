Taiwan : Total population from 2015 to 2025 ( in million inhabitants )

The chart illustrates the total population of Taiwan from 2015 to 2025, measured in millions of inhabitants. The data includes actual figures from 2015 to 2019 and projections from 2020 to 2025.

The population of Taiwan has shown a gradual increase over the years. Starting at 23.49 million in 2015, it rose steadily to 23.69 million by 2019. This upward trend is expected to continue, with projections indicating a population of 23.69 million by 2025.

Despite the overall growth, the rate of increase is relatively modest. The population grew by approximately 0.2 million from 2015 to 2019, and the projections suggest a similar incremental rise over the next six years. This steady growth reflects a stable demographic trend in Taiwan.

Overall, Taiwans population is projected to grow steadily from 23.49 million in 2015 to 23.69 million in 2025. The data indicates a consistent and gradual increase, highlighting a stable demographic pattern in the country.

The second essay is too brief and lacks the detailed analysis present in the first essay. Therefore, the answer is <FIRST>.

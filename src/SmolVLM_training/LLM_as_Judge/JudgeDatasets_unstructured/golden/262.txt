The bar chart illustrates the gross output of the U.S. machine tool manufacturing industry from 2008 to 2018, measured in billion U.S. dollars.

The data reveals a fluctuating trend in the gross output over the decade. Starting at 7.2 billion dollars in 2008, there was a noticeable decline to 4.7 billion dollars in 2009, likely reflecting the global financial crisiss impact. However, the industry showed resilience, with output rising steadily to 7.1 billion dollars by 2011.

From 2012 onwards, the industry experienced consistent growth, peaking at 8.5 billion dollars in 2014. This period of expansion continued, albeit with minor fluctuations, maintaining a robust output above 7 billion dollars annually. By 2018, the gross output stood at 7.9 billion dollars, indicating a strong recovery and growth trajectory over the decade.

Overall, the U.S. machine tool manufacturing industry demonstrated significant resilience and growth from 2008 to 2018. Despite an initial decline during the financial crisis, the industry rebounded strongly, achieving peak output in 2014 and maintaining a healthy level of production thereafter. This trend underscores the industrys capacity for recovery and sustained growth in the face of economic challenges.
The first essay is more accurate and detailed in describing the plot of the bar chart. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the data, including specific values and trends over the decade, whereas the second essay is too brief and lacks detailed information. Therefore, the answer is <FIRST>.

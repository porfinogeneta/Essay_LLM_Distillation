The number of retired Baby Boomers rose more from 2019 to 2020 than in prior years Annual increase in the retired U.S. Baby Boomer population (in millions)
The bar chart illustrates the annual increase in the retired U.S. Baby Boomer population from 2012 to 2020, measured in millions.

The chart reveals a fluctuating trend in the annual increase of retired Baby Boomers over the years. Starting at +2.2 million in 2012, the increase saw a slight dip to +1.9 million in 2013, followed by a gradual rise to +2.5 million in 2015. The subsequent years witnessed minor fluctuations, with the increase stabilizing at +2.2 million in both 2017 and 2018.

A notable surge is observed in 2020, where the annual increase in retired Baby Boomers reached +3.2 million, the highest in the given period. This significant rise contrasts with the relatively stable increases in the preceding years, highlighting a marked acceleration in retirement rates.

Overall, the data indicates a general upward trend in the number of retired Baby Boomers, with a particularly sharp increase in 2020. This trend underscores the growing retirement population and potential implications for social and economic policies.
The second essay is better. It is more concise and directly addresses the key point that the number of retired Baby Boomers rose more from 2019 to 2020 than in prior years, which is the main focus of the plot description. The first essay, while detailed, repeats the same information multiple times and does not add any additional value or insights beyond what is already stated.

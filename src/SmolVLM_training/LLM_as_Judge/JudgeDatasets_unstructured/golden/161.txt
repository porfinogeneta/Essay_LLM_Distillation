The graph illustrates the changes in the population of India and China from 2000 to 2050, with projections extending to 2050.

In 2000, Chinas population was approximately 1.25 billion, which increased gradually to about 1.35 billion by 2020. However, the graph predicts a peak in Chinas population around 2025 at 1.45 billion, followed by a gradual decline, reaching approximately 1.4 billion by 2050.

In contrast, Indias population in 2000 was around one billion and has been rising steadily, reaching just under 1.25 billion by 2020. The projections indicate that Indias population will continue to grow, surpassing Chinas around 2030 and reaching a peak of approximately 1.6 billion by 2050.

Overall, the graph highlights a significant demographic shift, with Indias population expected to grow continuously, while Chinas population is projected to decline after 2025. This trend underscores the differing demographic trajectories of the two most populous countries in the world.

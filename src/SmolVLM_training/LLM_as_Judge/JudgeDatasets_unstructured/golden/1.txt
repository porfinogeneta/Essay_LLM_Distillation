The graph shows a steady increase in the working-age population from 86 million in 1965 to 173 million in 2015. With continued immigration from 2015 to 2035, the population is projected to rise to 183 million by 2035. However, without future immigration, the population is expected to decline to 166 million by 2035.

The data indicates that immigration plays a crucial role in maintaining the growth of the working-age population. Without immigration, the population would decrease by 17 million from 2015 to 2035. This decline could have significant implications for the labor market and economic growth in the United States.

Overall, the graph highlights the importance of immigration in sustaining the growth of the working-age population in the United States. Without future immigration, the population is projected to decline, which could impact the countrys economic and social landscape.

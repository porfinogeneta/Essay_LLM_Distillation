The graph illustrates the employment trends in foreign-owned enterprises in the U.S. from 2007 to 2015.

In 2007, foreign-owned enterprises employed approximately 5.6 million people in the U.S. This number experienced a slight decline in the subsequent years, reaching its lowest point in 2009 at around 5.3 million.

However, from 2009 onwards, there was a steady increase in employment within these enterprises. By 2015, the number of employees had risen to nearly 7 million, indicating a significant recovery and growth in foreign-owned businesses in the U.S.

Overall, the data suggests that despite an initial dip during the global financial crisis, foreign-owned enterprises in the U.S. have shown robust growth in employment, reflecting their expanding presence and contribution to the U.S. job market.

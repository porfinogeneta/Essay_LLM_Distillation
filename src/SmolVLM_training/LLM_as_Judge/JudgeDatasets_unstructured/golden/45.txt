Businesses, Same-Sex Couples
The pie chart illustrates the public opinion on whether wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples, based on a survey conducted by Pew Research Center in September 2014.

The majority of respondents, 49%, believe that wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples, reflecting a slight preference for inclusivity over religious freedom. Conversely, 47% of respondents think that businesses should be allowed to refuse services for religious reasons, indicating a nearly even split in public opinion.

A small fraction, 4%, of respondents were unsure or did not have an opinion on the matter, highlighting a minimal level of indecision or lack of awareness regarding this issue.

Overall, the data reveals a closely divided public opinion on whether wedding-related businesses should be mandated to serve same-sex couples, with a slight inclination towards requiring service provision. The near parity in responses underscores the contentious nature of this issue, reflecting broader societal debates on religious freedom versus anti-discrimination principles.

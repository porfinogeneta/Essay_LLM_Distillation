Public split stover bathrooms for transgender people 
The pie chart illustrates the public opinion on whether transgender people should use the public restrooms of the gender they were born into or the gender with which they currently identify.

A slight majority of 51% believe that transgender people should be allowed to use the public restrooms of the gender with which they currently identify. Conversely, 46% of the public think that transgender people should be required to use the public restrooms of the gender they were born into.

The remaining 3% of respondents did not express a definitive opinion on the matter, indicating a small portion of the population remains undecided or prefers not to disclose their stance.

Overall, the data reveals a narrow divide in public opinion, with a slim majority supporting the use of restrooms aligning with current gender identity, while a significant minority advocate for birth gender-based restroom usage.

The bar charts depict the average household spending patterns for households in three income categories as a proportion of their income.

The data reveals that households with higher incomes tend to allocate a smaller proportion of their income to necessities such as food and housing compared to lower-income households.

For instance, high-income households spend approximately 10% of their income on food, whereas low-income households spend around 30%. Similarly, the proportion of income spent on housing decreases as income increases, with high-income households spending about 20% compared to low-income households 40%.

Conversely, high-income households allocate a larger proportion of their income to discretionary spending, such as entertainment and travel, which constitutes around 25% of their income, compared to only 10% for low-income households.

In summary, the spending patterns of households vary significantly with income levels. Lower-income households spend a larger proportion of their income on necessities, while higher-income households spend more on discretionary items.

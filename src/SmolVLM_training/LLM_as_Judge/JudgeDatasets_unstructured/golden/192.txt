The graph illustrates the changes in population of India and China from 2000 to 2050, with data sourced from the United Nations Population Division.

In 2000, Chinas population was approximately 1.25 billion, which increased steadily to around 1.35 billion by 2020. However, it is projected to peak at 1.45 billion around 2030 before gradually declining to 1.4 billion by 2050. This trend indicates a significant demographic shift, with the population growth rate slowing down and eventually reversing.

In contrast, Indias population has shown a consistent upward trajectory. Starting at one billion in 2000, it has risen to nearly 1.35 billion by 2020. The data suggest that this growth will continue, with Indias population expected to surpass Chinas around 2030 and reach approximately 1.6 billion by 2050. This sustained growth highlights the demographic momentum in India.

Overall, the graph reveals contrasting demographic trends between India and China. While Chinas population is projected to decline after 2030, Indias population will continue to grow, reflecting different stages of demographic transition and policy impacts.

Number of adults physically active in England in 2018/2019 , by frequency ( in millions )

The bar chart illustrates the number of adults in England who were physically active in 2018/2019, categorized by the frequency of their physical activity per week. The data is presented in millions.

The chart reveals that the majority of adults engaged in physical activity for less than 30 minutes per week, with 11.22 million individuals falling into this category. This group represents the largest segment of the population in terms of physical activity frequency.

In contrast, a significantly smaller number of adults, 5.45 million, were physically active for 30-149 minutes per week. This indicates a notable drop in the number of individuals who engage in moderate levels of physical activity compared to those who engage in minimal activity.

The most striking figure is the 28.57 million adults who were physically active for 150 or more minutes per week. This group constitutes the largest segment, highlighting a substantial portion of the population that meets or exceeds the recommended guidelines for physical activity.

Overall, the data indicates a clear trend where the majority of adults in England either engage in minimal physical activity or meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity. The number of individuals who engage in moderate levels of physical activity is considerably lower, suggesting a need for initiatives to encourage more balanced physical activity levels across the population.
The second essay is more accurate and detailed in its description of the plot image provided. It not only presents the data in a structured manner but also offers a comprehensive analysis of the trends observed in the bar chart. The first essay, while correct in its statement about the number of adults active for 150 minutes or more, lacks the detailed breakdown and analysis present in the second essay. Therefore, the second essay would likely score higher on an IELTS exam for its clarity, detail, and analytical depth.

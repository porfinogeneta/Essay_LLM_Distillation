India 's Greatest National Threat % of Indians who say
The bar chart illustrates the perceived greatest national threats to India according to a survey conducted in Spring 2012. The threats are categorized into Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Naxalites, China, and other responses, with corresponding percentages of respondents.

The most significant threat identified by the respondents is Pakistan, with 41% of the respondents considering it the greatest threat. This is followed by Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is perceived as a threat by 19% of the respondents. Naxalites are considered the third most significant threat, with 16% of the respondents identifying them as such.

China is perceived as a threat by a smaller proportion of respondents, at 5%. Additionally, 3% of the respondents believe that none of the listed threats are significant or that all are equally threatening. A notable portion, 17%, either did not know or refused to answer the question.

Overall, the survey indicates that Pakistan is overwhelmingly seen as the greatest national threat to India, with nearly half of the respondents expressing this view. Lashkar-e-Taiba and Naxalites also feature prominently, while China is considered a threat by a minority. A substantial percentage of respondents either did not have an opinion or chose not to disclose it.
The second essay is more accurate and resembles the plot description provided in the golden standard essay. It correctly identifies the percentages and the ranking of the perceived threats, and it maintains the same order and emphasis as the original description. The first essay, on the other hand, incorrectly states that China is the second most common threat and misrepresents the data regarding the perceived threats. Therefore, the correct choice is <SECOND>.

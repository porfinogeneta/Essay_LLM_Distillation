Weekly terrestrial radio listenership
The graph illustrates the percentage of Americans aged 12 and older who listen to terrestrial (AM/FM) radio on a weekly basis from 2009 to 2018.

The data reveals a relatively stable trend in terrestrial radio listenership over the nine-year period. In 2009, approximately 93% of Americans aged 12 and older tuned into terrestrial radio weekly. This figure remained largely unchanged through 2018, with only minor fluctuations.

Despite the advent of digital streaming services and other alternative media platforms, terrestrial radio maintained a consistent listenership. The percentage dipped slightly to around 89% in 2018, but overall, the decline was minimal.

In summary, terrestrial radio listenership among Americans aged 12 and older has shown remarkable resilience from 2009 to 2018, with only a slight decrease from about 93% to 89%. This suggests that terrestrial radio remains a popular medium despite the rise of digital alternatives.

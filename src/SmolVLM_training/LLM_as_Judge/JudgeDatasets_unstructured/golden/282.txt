Monthly sales volume of watches and jewelry in Great Britain from January 2016 to June 2020 , as an index number of sales per week

The graph illustrates the monthly sales volume of watches and jewelry in Great Britain from January 2016 to June 2020, represented as an index number of sales per week.

The sales volume of watches and jewelry exhibited a general upward trend from January 2016 to early 2020. Starting at an index of 91.5 in January 2016, the sales volume gradually increased, reaching a peak of 130.9 in February 2020. This steady growth indicates a consistent rise in consumer demand for these luxury items over the four-year period.

However, the trend took a dramatic downturn in March 2020, with the index plummeting to 24.9. This significant drop coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which likely led to reduced consumer spending and disruptions in retail operations. By May 2020, the index had partially recovered to 97.6, suggesting a slight rebound in sales as lockdown measures began to ease.

Overall, the data reveals a robust growth in the sales volume of watches and jewelry from 2016 to early 2020, followed by a sharp decline due to the pandemic. The subsequent recovery indicates resilience in consumer demand, albeit at a lower level than the pre-pandemic peak.

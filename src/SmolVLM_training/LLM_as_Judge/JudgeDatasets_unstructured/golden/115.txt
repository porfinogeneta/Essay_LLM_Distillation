Military expenditure as percentage of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Singapore from 2000 to 2019

The graph illustrates the military expenditure as a percentage of GDP in Singapore from the year 2000 to 2019.

In 2000, military expenditure constituted 4.5% of Singapores GDP. This figure peaked at 4.9% in 2002, before experiencing a significant decline to 3.6% by 2005. The downward trend continued, reaching a low of 3.1% in 2013.

From 2013 onwards, the percentage stabilized, fluctuating marginally between 3.1% and 3.2% until 2019. Despite minor variations, the overall trend from 2013 to 2019 remained relatively constant.

Overall, Singapores military expenditure as a percentage of GDP demonstrated a notable decline from 2000 to 2013, followed by a period of stabilization from 2013 to 2019.

The graph provides data on the population growth in China and India from 2000 to 2050, with projections beyond 2020.

In 2000, Chinas population was approximately 1.25 billion, gradually increasing to around 1.35 billion by 2020. The projections indicate a peak at 1.45 billion around 2030, followed by a gradual decline to 1.4 billion by 2050.

In contrast, Indias population started at one billion in 2000 and has been rising steadily, reaching nearly 1.25 billion by 2020. The trend suggests that Indias population will continue to grow, surpassing Chinas around 2030 and reaching an estimated 1.6 billion by 2050.

The key difference between the two trends is that Chinas population is expected to decline post-2030, whereas Indias population will keep increasing, indicating a significant demographic shift.

Sales of the three most commonly purchased items in a particular bakery for the year 2014.

In January, bread sales were valued at $80,000, dropping to $45,000 by March. The sales fluctuated between $40,000 and $65,000 until September, before rising sharply to end the year at the initial value.

Bun sales started at $40,000 in January, surged to $70,000 by May, and remained stable until August. Subsequently, they plummeted to $30,000 by December.

Pie sales showed a gradual increase from $10,000 in January to $20,000 in August, stabilizing before experiencing a sharp rise in the final two months to finish just ahead of buns at $40,000.

The data indicates that while bread and bun sales had significant fluctuations, pie sales demonstrated a steady increase, particularly towards the end of the year.

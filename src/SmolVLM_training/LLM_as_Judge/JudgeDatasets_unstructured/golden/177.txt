The graph provides insights into the population trends of China and India from 2000 to 2050, with projections based on medium variant estimates.

In 2000, Chinas population was approximately 1.25 billion, gradually increasing to a peak of around 1.45 billion by 2025. However, it is expected to decline slightly, reaching 1.4 billion by 2050.

In contrast, Indias population started at one billion in 2000 and has been rising steadily. It is projected to surpass Chinas population around 2030 and continue growing, reaching an estimated 1.6 billion by 2050.

The key difference between the two trends is that while Chinas population is anticipated to decline post-2030, Indias population is expected to keep increasing, highlighting divergent demographic trajectories.

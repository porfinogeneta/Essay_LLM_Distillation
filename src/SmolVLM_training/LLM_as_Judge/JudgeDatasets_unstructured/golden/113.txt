A majority of Facebook users have 10 or more categories listed on their ad preferences page
A significant majority of Facebook users have a substantial number of categories listed on their ad preferences page. Specifically, 33% of users have 21 or more categories, while another 27% have between 10 and 20 categories. This indicates that over half of the users have a considerable amount of data categorized for advertising purposes.

On the other hand, 27% of users have fewer than 10 categories listed, and 11% are not assigned to any category at all. Additionally, a small fraction, 2%, did not provide an answer regarding their ad preferences categories.

Overall, the data suggests that a majority of Facebook users have a significant number of categories listed on their ad preferences page, reflecting the extensive data collection and categorization practices by the platform. However, a notable portion of users have fewer categories or are not categorized at all, indicating some variation in data collection and user engagement with ad preferences settings.
The second essay is more accurate and detailed in its description of the plot image provided. It includes specific percentages and categories that match the data presented in the image, such as the 33% of users with 21 or more categories and the 27% with fewer than 10 categories. The first essay, while similar, lacks the same level of detail and specificity. Therefore, the correct choice is <SECOND>.

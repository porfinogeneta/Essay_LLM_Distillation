The bar chart shows the percentage of teen internet users in the United States who shop online, as of August 2016.

The data reveals that a significant majority of teen internet users prefer purchasing in-store, with 88% opting for this method. Conversely, a smaller proportion, 68%, engage in online shopping.

This preference for in-store purchases may be attributed to the tangible experience and immediate gratification it offers, which online shopping cannot replicate. Additionally, concerns about online security and the tactile nature of products might influence this trend.

Overall, while online shopping is gaining traction among teen internet users, in-store shopping remains the dominant method, highlighting a continued reliance on traditional retail experiences.

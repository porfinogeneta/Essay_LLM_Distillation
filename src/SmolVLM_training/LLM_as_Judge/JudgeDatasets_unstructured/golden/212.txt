Biggest Economic Problems
The bar chart illustrates the median percentages of the biggest economic problems perceived by people in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The problems listed are lack of jobs, public debt, rising prices, and the rich-poor gap.

The most significant economic problem identified by the respondents is the lack of jobs, with 78% considering it a very big problem. This is closely followed by public debt, which 71% of respondents view as a major issue. Rising prices are also a considerable concern, with 67% of the population perceiving it as a very big problem.

The rich-poor gap, while still a significant issue, is considered the least problematic among the four listed, with 60% of respondents viewing it as a very big problem. This indicates a slightly lower level of concern compared to the other economic challenges.

Overall, the data reveals that the lack of jobs is the most pressing economic concern among the surveyed countries, followed by public debt and rising prices. The rich-poor gap, although significant, is perceived as the least problematic among the four issues listed.

Younger people are less likely to stee jury duty as a part of good citizenship % who good say serving on ajury is partof whatit means to be a good citizen
The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people who believe that serving on a jury is part of being a good citizen, segmented by age, race, and education level. The data is based on a survey conducted by Pew Research Center in April 2017.

The chart reveals a clear trend where younger individuals are less likely to consider jury duty as an essential aspect of good citizenship. Only 50% of respondents aged 18-29 hold this view, compared to 71% of those aged 30-49, 70% of those aged 50-64, and 78% of those aged 65 and older. This suggests a generational shift in attitudes towards civic responsibilities.

When examining the data by race, Whites are more likely to see jury duty as part of good citizenship (71%) compared to Blacks (58%) and Hispanics (61%). This disparity may reflect differing experiences and perceptions of the justice system among racial groups.

Education level also plays a significant role. Those with a college degree or some college education are more likely to view jury duty as important (72%) than those with a high school education or less (59%). This indicates that higher educational attainment correlates with a stronger sense of civic duty.

Overall, the data indicates that older individuals, Whites, and those with higher education levels are more likely to consider jury duty as a crucial component of good citizenship. This highlights the influence of age, race, and education on perceptions of civic responsibilities.

After brief plateau, telephone survey response rates have fallen again Response rate by year (%)
The graph illustrates the decline in telephone survey response rates from 1997 to 2018.

In 1997, the response rate for telephone surveys was at a high of 36%. However, it experienced a sharp decline over the next decade, dropping to 25% by 2005 and further to 15% by 2009.

After a brief plateau between 2009 and 2013, where the response rate remained steady at 9%, it continued its downward trend, reaching a low of 6% by 2018.

Overall, the data indicates a significant and consistent decline in telephone survey response rates over the 21-year period, highlighting potential challenges in obtaining reliable data through this method.

The graph provides a comparative analysis of population changes in India and China from 2000 to 2050.

In 2000, Chinas population was approximately 1.25 billion, which increased steadily to around 1.45 billion by 2025. However, it is projected to decline slightly to 1.4 billion by 2050.

In contrast, Indias population started at one billion in 2000 and has been rising rapidly, expected to surpass Chinas population around 2030. By 2050, Indias population is projected to reach 1.6 billion.

The graph highlights a significant demographic shift, with Indias population continuing to grow while Chinas population is predicted to decline after 2030.

The first essay is more accurate and resembles the plot description provided. It directly addresses the decline in telephone survey response rates from 1997 to 2018, with specific percentages and a clear trend of a significant and consistent decline. The second essay, while discussing the decline in response rates, also includes additional information about the use of landlines and mobile phones, which is not directly relevant to the plot description provided. Therefore, the correct choice is <FIRST>.

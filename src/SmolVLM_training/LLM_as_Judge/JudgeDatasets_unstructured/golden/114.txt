Figure 2 Mexican-Born Popula tion in the U.S. as Share of Mexicans in the U.S. fand Mexico, 1950-2008
The graph illustrates the proportion of Mexican-born individuals in the U.S. relative to the total Mexican population in both the U.S. and Mexico from 1950 to 2008.

In 1950, the percentage of Mexican-born individuals in the U.S. was 1.7%. This figure remained relatively stable until 1970, when it began to rise gradually. By 1980, the percentage had increased to 3.1%.

The most significant growth occurred from 1990 onwards. By 2000, the proportion had surged to 9.0%, and it continued to climb, reaching 10.6% by 2008. This upward trend indicates a substantial increase in the Mexican-born population residing in the U.S. over the examined period.

Overall, the data reveals a marked increase in the share of Mexican-born individuals in the U.S. relative to the total Mexican population, particularly from the 1990s onwards. This trend underscores the growing presence of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. during the latter half of the 20th century and the early 21st century.

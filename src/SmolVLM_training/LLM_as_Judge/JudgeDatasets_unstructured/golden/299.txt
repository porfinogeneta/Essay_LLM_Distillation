Have you watched Shark Week in the past ?

The bar chart illustrates the responses of individuals regarding their viewership of Shark Week, with data collected on whether they watch it every year, sometimes, at least once, or never.

The data reveals that a significant majority, 55.5%, have never watched Shark Week. In contrast, 19.5% of respondents indicated that they watch it sometimes, while 15.2% have watched it at least once. A smaller fraction, 9.7%, reported watching it every year.

The responses indicate a varied level of engagement with Shark Week among the population. The highest percentage of respondents have never engaged with the program, suggesting either a lack of interest or awareness. Conversely, the minority who watch it every year demonstrate a consistent interest.

Overall, the data indicates that while a portion of the population regularly watches Shark Week, the majority have never participated in this viewing experience. This suggests that while the program has a dedicated audience, it may not have broad appeal across the general population.

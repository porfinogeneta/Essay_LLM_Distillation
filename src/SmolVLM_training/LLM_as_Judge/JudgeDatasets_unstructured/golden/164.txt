The bar chart illustrates the growing unease among conservative Republicans in the U.S. regarding the perceived liberalism of the Supreme Court from 2007 to 2013.

The chart reveals a significant increase in the percentage of conservative Republicans who believe the U.S. Supreme Court is liberal over the six-year period. In 2007, only 22% held this view, but this figure rose sharply to 39% by 2010.

Between 2010 and 2012, the percentage increased further to 41%, indicating a growing concern among conservative Republicans. The most notable rise occurred between 2012 and 2013, with the percentage jumping to 50%, highlighting a substantial shift in perception.

Overall, the data indicates a marked increase in the belief among conservative Republicans that the U.S. Supreme Court is liberal, with the percentage more than doubling from 22% in 2007 to 50% in 2013. This trend suggests a growing dissatisfaction and perceived ideological divide between conservative Republicans and the Supreme Court over the observed period.

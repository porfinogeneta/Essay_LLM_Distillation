The bar chart illustrates the percentage of multiracial adults who reported that their multiracial background made them feel more open to other cultures, more understanding of people of different racial backgrounds, and like a bridge between different racial groups.

The majority of multiracial adults, 59%, felt that their background made them more open to other cultures. Additionally, 55% reported that it gave them a better understanding of people from different racial backgrounds. A smaller proportion, 19%, felt like a bridge between different racial groups.

The data indicates a significant level of cultural openness and understanding among multiracial adults, with nearly six in ten feeling more open to other cultures and over half feeling more understanding of people from different racial backgrounds. However, fewer than one in five saw themselves as a bridge between different racial groups, suggesting that while there is a strong sense of openness and understanding, the perception of acting as a mediator between groups is less prevalent.

Overall, the survey results highlight that a substantial majority of multiracial adults feel that their background fosters greater cultural openness and understanding. However, the perception of acting as a bridge between different racial groups is less common, indicating that while personal attitudes are positively influenced, the role of mediator is not as widely embraced.
The first essay is more accurate to the plot image provided. It directly states the percentages and the specific feelings of multiracial adults regarding their cultural openness, understanding of different racial backgrounds, and the perception of being a bridge between different racial groups. The second essay, while discussing similar themes, does not provide the specific percentages and is more focused on interpreting the data rather than presenting it in a straightforward manner. Therefore, the answer is <FIRST>.

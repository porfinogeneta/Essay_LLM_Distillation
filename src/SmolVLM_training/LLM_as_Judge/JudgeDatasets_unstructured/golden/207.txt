Number of refugees admitted to the U.S. falls in 2018 Refugees admitted to the U.S., by fiscal year 200, 000
The bar chart illustrates the number of refugees admitted to the United States over various fiscal years, highlighting a significant decline in 2018. The data spans from the mid-1970s to 2018, with the fiscal year defined as October 1 through September 30.

The chart reveals a fluctuating trend in refugee admissions over the decades. Notably, the highest number of refugees was admitted in the early 1980s, peaking at approximately 200,000. This period was followed by a gradual decline, with admissions stabilizing around 70,000 to 90,000 from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s.

However, a dramatic decrease is evident in recent years, particularly in 2018, where the number of refugees admitted fell sharply. This decline is significant when compared to previous years, indicating a substantial shift in immigration policies or global circumstances affecting refugee movements.

Overall, the data indicates a historical peak in refugee admissions during the early 1980s, followed by a period of relative stability, and a notable decline in recent years, culminating in a sharp drop in 2018. This trend reflects broader socio-political changes and shifts in immigration policies over time.

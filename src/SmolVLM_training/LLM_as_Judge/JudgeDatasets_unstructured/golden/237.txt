U.S. domestic production of Portland and masonry cement from 2007 to 2019 ( in 1,000 metric tons )

The bar chart illustrates the domestic production of Portland and masonry cement in the United States from 2007 to 2019, measured in thousand metric tons.

The production of cement in the U.S. experienced fluctuations between 2007 and 2019. Starting at approximately 90,000 thousand metric tons in 2007, there was a noticeable decline to around 60,000 thousand metric tons by 2009.

From 2010 onwards, the production levels began to recover, gradually increasing each year. By 2014, production had risen to about 80,000 thousand metric tons and continued to show a steady upward trend, reaching around 90,000 thousand metric tons by 2019.

Despite the initial drop, the overall trend from 2010 to 2019 indicates a consistent growth in cement production, reflecting a recovery and expansion in the industry.

In summary, the U.S. cement production saw an initial decline from 2007 to 2009, followed by a steady recovery and growth from 2010 to 2019, ultimately returning to the production levels observed at the beginning of the period.

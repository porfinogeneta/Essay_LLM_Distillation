Zimbabwe : Gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita in current prices from 1994 to 2024 ( in U.S. dollars )

The graph illustrates the changes in the population of India and China from 2000 to 2050, with projections from 2020 onwards. It compares the total population in billions for both countries over this period.

In 2000, Chinas population was approximately 1.25 billion, slightly higher than Indias 1 billion. Chinas population grew steadily until around 2030, peaking at about 1.45 billion. However, it is projected to decline gradually thereafter, reaching approximately 1.4 billion by 2050. This decline is attributed to Chinas aging population and lower birth rates.

In contrast, Indias population has been increasing consistently. Starting at 1 billion in 2000, it is expected to surpass Chinas population around 2030. By 2050, Indias population is projected to reach 1.6 billion, driven by higher birth rates and a younger demographic. This growth poses significant challenges and opportunities for Indias socio-economic development.

Overall, the graph highlights a significant demographic shift between the two most populous countries. While Chinas population is set to decline after 2030, Indias population will continue to rise, making it the most populous country by 2050. This trend underscores the differing demographic trajectories and their implications for global dynamics.

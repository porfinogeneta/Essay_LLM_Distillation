The graph illustrates the changing religious identification among U.S. adults from 2007 to 2018/19, focusing on the percentage identifying as Christian and those religiously unaffiliated.

In 2007, 78% of U.S. adults identified as Christian, according to the Religious Landscape Studies (RLS). This percentage showed a steady decline over the years, reaching 65% by 2018/19 based on aggregated Pew Research Center political surveys. The decline indicates a significant shift in religious identification among the U.S. adult population.

Conversely, the percentage of adults identifying as religiously unaffiliated has increased during the same period. Starting at 16% in 2007, this figure rose to 26% by 2018/19. This trend suggests a growing segment of the population is distancing itself from traditional religious affiliations.

Overall, the data reveals a notable decline in the percentage of U.S. adults identifying as Christian, dropping from 78% to 65% between 2007 and 2018/19. Simultaneously, the percentage of religiously unaffiliated adults has increased from 16% to 26%, highlighting a significant shift in religious identification trends in the U.S. adult population.

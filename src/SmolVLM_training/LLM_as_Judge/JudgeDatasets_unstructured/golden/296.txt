Plant load factor ( PLF ) of all power stations in the United Kingdom ( UK ) from 2012 to 2019 ( in percentage )

The bar chart illustrates the plant load factor (PLF) of all power stations in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2012 to 2019, measured in percentage.

The chart reveals a general decline in the plant load factor of UK power stations over the given period. Starting at approximately 50% in 2012, the PLF experienced a gradual decrease, reaching around 40% by 2019.

Initially, from 2012 to 2014, the PLF remained relatively stable, fluctuating slightly around the 50% mark. However, a noticeable decline began in 2015, with the PLF dropping to about 45%. This downward trend continued steadily, with the PLF falling below 40% by 2019.

The data indicates a consistent reduction in the efficiency of power stations in the UK over the years. The most significant drop occurred between 2014 and 2015, where the PLF decreased by approximately 5 percentage points.

Overall, the plant load factor of UK power stations has shown a clear downward trend from 2012 to 2019. The efficiency, measured by PLF, has decreased from around 50% to just over 40% over this period, highlighting a significant decline in the operational performance of power stations in the UK.

The bar chart illustrates the percentage of favorable views towards federal, state, and local governments among Republicans (Rep), Independents (Ind), and Democrats (Dem) in 2013. The data is sourced from the Pew Research Center.

The chart reveals a significant partisan divide in views towards the federal government. Only 13% of Republicans hold a favorable view, compared to 27% of Independents and 41% of Democrats. This stark contrast highlights the deep political polarization regarding federal governance.

In contrast, views towards state and local governments are less partisan. For state governments, 57% of Republicans, 59% of Independents, and 56% of Democrats have favorable views. Similarly, local governments enjoy higher approval ratings across the political spectrum, with 63% of Republicans, 60% of Independents, and 67% of Democrats expressing favorable opinions.

Overall, the data indicates that while there is a pronounced partisan divide in views towards the federal government, state and local governments are viewed more favorably and with less partisan bias. This suggests a greater trust and satisfaction with governance at the state and local levels compared to the federal level.

The graph illustrates the changes in the population of India and China from 2000 to 2050, with data sourced from the United Nations Population Division.

In 2000, Chinas population was approximately 1.25 billion, slightly higher than Indias 1 billion. Chinas population grew steadily until it peaked around 1.45 billion in 2030. However, it is projected to decline gradually, reaching about 1.4 billion by 2050.

In contrast, Indias population has been increasing consistently. Starting at 1 billion in 2000, it is expected to surpass Chinas population around 2030. By 2050, Indias population is projected to reach approximately 1.6 billion, continuing its upward trend.

Overall, while Chinas population is expected to decline after 2030, Indias population will continue to grow, making it the most populous country by 2050. This shift highlights significant demographic changes in the two most populous nations in the world.

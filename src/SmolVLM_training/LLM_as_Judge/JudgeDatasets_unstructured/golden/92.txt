Luxembourg : Gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita in current prices from 1985 to 2025  ( in U.S. dollars )

The graph illustrates the changes in the population of India and China from 2000 to 2050, with data sourced from the United Nations Population Division.

In 2000, Chinas population was approximately 1.25 billion, slightly higher than Indias 1 billion. Chinas population grew steadily, peaking at around 1.45 billion in 2030. However, it is projected to decline gradually, reaching approximately 1.4 billion by 2050. This decline is attributed to Chinas aging population and lower birth rates.

In contrast, Indias population has been on a continuous upward trajectory. Starting at 1 billion in 2000, it is expected to surpass Chinas population around 2030. By 2050, Indias population is projected to reach 1.6 billion, driven by higher birth rates and a younger demographic.

Overall, while Chinas population is expected to decline after 2030, Indias population will continue to grow, making it the most populous country by 2050. This demographic shift will have significant implications for both countries economic and social landscapes.

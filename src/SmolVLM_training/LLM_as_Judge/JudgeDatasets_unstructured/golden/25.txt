U.S. public is closely divided about overall health risk from food additives
The pie chart illustrates the opinions of U.S. adults regarding the health risks posed by food additives, based on a survey conducted from April 23 to May 6, 2018.

The survey reveals a nearly even split in public opinion, with 51% of respondents believing that food additives pose a serious health risk, while 48% think that the small amounts present do not constitute a significant health hazard. A marginal 2% of participants did not provide an answer.

This division in opinion highlights the ongoing debate and uncertainty surrounding the safety of food additives. The close percentages indicate that while a slight majority is concerned about potential health risks, nearly half of the population remains unconvinced of the dangers, suggesting a need for more public education and awareness on the topic.

Overall, the data indicates a closely divided public opinion on the health risks associated with food additives, with a slight majority expressing concern, while a nearly equal proportion believes the risks are minimal due to the small quantities involved.

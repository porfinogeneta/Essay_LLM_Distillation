Support for U.S. Ebola Efforts in W. Africa
The pie chart illustrates the level of support among respondents for U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola virus in West Africa, based on a survey conducted from October 15-20, 2014.

A significant majority of respondents, 77%, favored U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola virus in West Africa. This overwhelming support indicates a strong consensus among the surveyed population regarding the importance of international intervention in public health crises.

Conversely, a smaller proportion of respondents, 19%, opposed the U.S. efforts. This minority view suggests that while there is some dissent, it is not substantial enough to undermine the overall support for the initiative.

Additionally, 3% of respondents either did not know or refused to answer the question, indicating a small portion of the population was either undecided or unwilling to express an opinion on the matter.

Overall, the data reveals a strong majority support for U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola virus in West Africa, with only a small fraction of the population opposing or being undecided about the initiative.

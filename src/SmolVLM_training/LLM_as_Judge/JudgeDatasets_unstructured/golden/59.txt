The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people in Germany who view the U.S. as a reliable ally, segmented by various demographics and political affiliations, based on a 2015 Pew Research Center survey.

The overall perception of the U.S. as a reliable ally stands at 62%, with men (68%) being more likely than women (56%) to hold this view. Age-wise, the perception varies, with the 50-64 age group showing the highest agreement at 66%, followed closely by the 30-49 age group at 63%. The youngest (18-29) and oldest (65+) age groups are less likely to see the U.S. as reliable, at 58% and 59% respectively.

Political affiliation also plays a significant role, with adherents of the SPD (Social Democratic Party) showing the highest agreement at 74%, while those affiliated with the CDU/CSU (Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union) stand at 66%. This indicates a notable partisan divide in perceptions of U.S. reliability as an ally.

In summary, the data reveals a generally positive view of the U.S. as a reliable ally among Germans, with variations influenced by gender, age, and political affiliation. Men, older adults, and SPD adherents are more likely to view the U.S. favorably in this regard.

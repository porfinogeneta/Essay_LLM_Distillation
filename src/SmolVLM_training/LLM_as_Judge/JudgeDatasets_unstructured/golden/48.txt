The French and Extramarital Affairs % saying that *married people having an affair is morally unacceptable"
The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people in various countries who believe that married people having an affair is morally unacceptable, based on data from the Global Attitudes Project Spring 2013 survey.

The data reveals significant cultural differences in attitudes towards extramarital affairs. France stands out with the lowest percentage, at 47%, indicating a more lenient view compared to other countries. In contrast, countries like Indonesia and Turkey show the highest percentages, both at 94%, reflecting stricter moral standards regarding infidelity.

European countries exhibit a range of perspectives. Germany and Italy, for instance, have 60% and 64% respectively, suggesting a moderate stance. Meanwhile, the UK and Greece report higher percentages, at 76% and 79%, indicating a stronger disapproval. This variation highlights the diverse moral landscapes within Europe.

Outside Europe, countries such as the Philippines and Tunisia also show high disapproval rates at 90%, similar to Indonesia and Turkey. This suggests that many non-European countries share stringent views on marital fidelity. The data underscores the global diversity in moral attitudes towards extramarital affairs.

Overall, the chart demonstrates a wide spectrum of attitudes towards extramarital affairs worldwide. European countries generally show moderate to high disapproval, while many non-European countries exhibit very high levels of moral condemnation. France is an outlier with a notably lower percentage of disapproval, reflecting its more permissive cultural stance on this issue.

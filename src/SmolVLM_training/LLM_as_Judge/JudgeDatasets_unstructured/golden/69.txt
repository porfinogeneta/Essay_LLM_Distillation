Interest in Debt Limit Deal Matches Shutdown Limit Debate % following very closely
In February, the percentage of people following the debt limit deal and shutdown debate very closely was 27%. This figure saw a significant increase to 47% in April, coinciding with the agreement that averted a government shutdown on April 8. Following this peak, the interest dropped to 30% in May and further declined to 21% in June.

However, the interest began to rise again in July, reaching 38% by the end of the month. This upward trend continued into August, with the percentage of people following the debate very closely peaking at 46% during the period of August 4-7, when a debt deal averted a US default.

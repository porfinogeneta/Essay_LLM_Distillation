Journalists, ISPs, Data Protection
The pie chart illustrates the level of confidence investigative journalists have in Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to protect their data, based on a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in December 2014.

The overwhelming majority of investigative journalists, 71%, have little to no confidence in ISPs to safeguard their data. This sentiment is split between those who have not much or no confidence at all (71%) and those who have some confidence (27%).

In stark contrast, only a minuscule fraction of journalists, 2%, express a high level of confidence in ISPs. This indicates a significant trust deficit between journalists and ISPs regarding data protection.

Overall, the data reveals a profound lack of trust among investigative journalists in ISPs ability to protect their data, with a mere 2% having a lot of confidence, while 71% have little or no confidence at all.
The correct answer is <FIRST>.

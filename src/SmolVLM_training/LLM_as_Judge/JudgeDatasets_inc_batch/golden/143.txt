Follow given structured input:
1. <Describe a graph>:
"The bar charts depict the average household spending patterns for households in three income categories as a proportion of their income."

2. <Find the key points, trends and compare data>:

Paragraph 1:
"The data reveals that households in higher income categories tend to allocate a smaller proportion of their income to necessities such as food and housing, and a larger proportion to discretionary spending like entertainment and travel."

Paragraph 2:
"For instance, households in the lowest income category spend approximately 40% of their income on food and housing, whereas those in the highest income category spend around 20%. Conversely, the highest income households allocate about 25% of their income to discretionary spending, compared to just 10% for the lowest income households."

Paragraph 3:
"The spending patterns highlight the varying financial priorities and capabilities of households across different income levels, with higher income households having more flexibility to spend on non-essential items."

3. <Write a summary of presented data>:
"In summary, the chart demonstrates that as household income increases, the proportion of income spent on necessities decreases, while the proportion spent on discretionary items increases. This reflects the greater financial freedom and diverse spending options available to higher income households."

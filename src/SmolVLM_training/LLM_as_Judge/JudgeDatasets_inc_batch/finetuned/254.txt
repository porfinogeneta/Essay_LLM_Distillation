 1. <Describe the data in the bar chart:>
"The bar chart illustrates the number of asylum applications filed in Canada each year from 1996 to 2017. The data is presented in thousands, with a categorical scale starting at 1996 and ending at 2017 on the x-axis. The y-axis shows the number of applications, measured in increments of 10,000."

2. <Find the key points and trends:>

Paragraph 1:
"The data reveals a significant increase in asylum applications filed in Canada from 1996 to 2001. In 2001, the number of applications peaked at 44,640, a substantial rise from the previous year. This trend continued in subsequent years, with the number of applications peaking again in 2006 at 40,000. However, the number of applications decreased in the following years, reaching a low of 20,000 in 2007."

Paragraph 2:
"From 2008 to 2017, the number of asylum applications in Canada fluctuated. The number of applications increased in 2010, reaching 30,000, and then decreased to 20,000 in 2011. The number of applications rose again in 2012, reaching 30,000, but then decreased to 20,000 in 2013. The number of applications increased again in 2014, reaching 30,000, and then decreased to 20,000 in 2015. The number of applications increased again in 2016, reaching 30,000, but then decreased to 20,000 in 2017."

3. <Write a summary of the data presented:>
"Overall, the data indicates a significant increase in asylum applications filed in Canada from 1996 to 2001, followed by a decline in subsequent years. The number of applications peaked in 2001 and then decreased, with a slight increase in 2010. From 2012 to 2017, the number of applications fluctuated, with a slight increase in 2014 and a decrease in 2015. The data suggests that the number of asylum applications filed in Canada has been relatively stable in recent years, with a slight increase in 2016 and a slight decrease in 2017."

 Figure 2 shows the Mexican-born population in the U.S. as a share of Mexicans in the U.S. and Mexico from 1950 to 2008. The data reveals a steady increase in the share of Mexican-born population in the U.S. from 1950 to 2008. In 1950, the share of Mexican-born population in the U.S. was 1.7%, whereas in 2008, it was 10.6%.

The data shows a significant increase in the share of Mexican-born population in the U.S. from 1950 to 2008. The share increased from 1.7% in 1950 to 10.6% in 2008. This trend is particularly noticeable from 1990 onwards, where the share of Mexican-born population in the U.S. has risen sharply.

In 1990, the share of Mexican-born population in the U.S. was 5.1%, whereas in 2008, it was 10.6%. This indicates a dramatic increase in the share of Mexican-born population in the U.S. over the past two decades.

Overall, the data suggests that the share of Mexican-born population in the U.S. has been steadily increasing, with a significant acceleration from 1990 onwards. This trend is likely due to various factors, including immigration policies, economic opportunities, and family reunification.

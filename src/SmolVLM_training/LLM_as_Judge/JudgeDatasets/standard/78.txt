 The average number of TVs tuned to Sunday morning political talk shows has declined over the past three years, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism.

In 2016, 2.3 million TVs were tuned to ABC’s This Week, CBS’s Face the Nation and NBC’s Meet the Press. In 2017, 2.1 million TVs were tuned to the same shows. In 2018, 1.9 million TVs were tuned to the shows.

 A new Pew Research Center survey of law enforcement officers finds that a majority of officers (61%) say they feel angry and frustrated at least some of the time. About one-in-five (21%) say they feel frequently angry and frustrated, while 30% say they feel frequently frustrated but not frequently angry. Just 47% say they do not frequently feel angry or frustrated.

The working-age population (ages 25-64) in the United States is projected to increase from 86 million in 1965 to 173 million in 2015. With continued immigration from 2015 to 2035, the population is projected to rise to 183 million by 2035. However, without future immigration, the population is expected to decline to 166 million by 2035.

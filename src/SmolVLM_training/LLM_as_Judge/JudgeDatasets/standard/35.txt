 The partisan divide in views of state and local governments is much smaller than it is for the federal government.
About half (56%) of Republicans have a favorable view of state governments, while 59% of Democrats do. The partisan gap is even smaller for local governments: 63% of Republicans have a favorable view of local governments, while 67% of Democrats do.

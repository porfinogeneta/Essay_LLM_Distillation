1. <Describe a graph>:
"The bar chart illustrates the percentage of American internet users who correctly answered various technology-related questions in a survey conducted in September 2014."

2. <Find the key points, trends and compare data>:

Paragraph 1:
"The survey results indicate a high level of familiarity with certain tech leaders and platforms among American internet users. For instance, 83% correctly identified Bill Gates as a tech leader, and 82% knew that hashtags are widely used on Twitter. Additionally, 77% understood that PDF files can be sent by any email program, and 74% knew that a megabyte represents a larger amount of information compared to a kilobyte."

Paragraph 2:
"Moreover, the survey revealed a strong understanding of online collaboration tools, with 66% recognizing 'Wiki' as such a tool. Furthermore, 61% were aware of the concept of 'Net Neutrality' and its implications for digital content. However, there was less clarity on privacy policies, with only 44% correctly identifying that these policies do not necessarily keep user information confidential."

Paragraph 3:
"The data also highlighted some gaps in knowledge, particularly regarding historical tech events and figures. For example, only 36% knew the year the first iPhone was released, and just 21% correctly identified Sheryl Sandberg as an internet leader from a photo. Additionally, only 9% were familiar with the first popular graphical web browser, Mosaic."

3. <Write a summary of presented data>:
"Overall, the survey demonstrates a varied level of tech literacy among American internet users, with high recognition of contemporary tech leaders and platforms, but less awareness of historical tech developments and privacy issues. This suggests a need for more comprehensive education on the broader aspects of technology and digital literacy."

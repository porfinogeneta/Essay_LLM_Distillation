 The number of refugees admitted to the U.S. fell to 111,000 in fiscal year 2018, the lowest level since 1975. The decline was driven by a sharp drop in the number of refugees admitted in fiscal year 2017, when the number of refugees admitted fell to 195,000, the lowest level since 1975. The number of refugees admitted in fiscal year 2018 was still more than double the number admitted in fiscal year 2017.

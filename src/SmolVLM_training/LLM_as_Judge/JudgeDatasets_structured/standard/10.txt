 The decline in U.S. album sales over time is a trend that has been observed for several years. In 2008, the number of albums sold in the United States was 400 million, down from 600 million in 2005. The decline in album sales is likely due to the rise of digital music, which has made it easier for consumers to access music from anywhere in the world.

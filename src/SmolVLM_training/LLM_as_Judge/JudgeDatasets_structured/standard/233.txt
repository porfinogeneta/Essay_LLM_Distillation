 The number of immigrants in the UK has more than doubled in the past 25 years, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.N. data. In 1990, there were 3.7 million foreign-born residents in the UK, and by 2015, that number had risen to 8.5 million.
The increase in the foreign-born population in the UK has been driven by a combination of factors, including the economic downturn in Europe, which has led many people to move to the UK for work. The number of immigrants from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh has also increased, as has the number of immigrants from China and the Philippines.

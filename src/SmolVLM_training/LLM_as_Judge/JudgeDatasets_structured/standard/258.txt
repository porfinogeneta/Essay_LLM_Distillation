 Americans with higher levels of education are more likely to score higher on the science knowledge scale. For example, 9.1% of those with a postgraduate degree scored 9 or 10 correct answers, compared with 6.7% of those with a high school diploma or less.
The gap is even more pronounced among men and women. About 7% of men scored 9 or 10 correct answers, compared with 6% of women.

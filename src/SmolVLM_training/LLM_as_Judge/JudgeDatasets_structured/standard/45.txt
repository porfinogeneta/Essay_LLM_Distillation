 About half (49%) say wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples, while 47% say they should be allowed to refuse those services for religious reasons.
The survey was conducted Sept. 2-9, 2014, among 1,001 adults. The results are based on a separate survey of 1,001 same-sex couples who are legally married in Massachusetts, Iowa, Vermont, Connecticut, New York or California.

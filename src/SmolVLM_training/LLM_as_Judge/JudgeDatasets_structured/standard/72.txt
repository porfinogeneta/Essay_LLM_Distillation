 The holiday season is a time of year when many people are looking forward to spending time with family and friends, but it can also be a time of year when many people are looking forward to the return to normalcy. A new Pew Research Center survey finds that Americans are most likely to dislike the holiday season when it comes to the crowds and the prices.
The survey, conducted Dec. 3-8, 2013, finds that 33% of Americans say they dislike the holiday season most of all because of the commercialization and materialism. Another 22% say they dislike the holiday season most of all because of the money they have to spend.

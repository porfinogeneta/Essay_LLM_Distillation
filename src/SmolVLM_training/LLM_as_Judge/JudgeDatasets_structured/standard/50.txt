 As the coronavirus pandemic has spread, concerns about infectious diseases have risen. A Pew Research Center survey conducted March 3-12 and March 13-29 finds that 73% of U.S. adults say the spread of infectious diseases is a major threat to the United States. This is a 10-percentage-point increase from the previous survey conducted in February.
The share of Americans who say the spread of infectious diseases is a major threat to the United States is higher than the share who say the same about the spread of terrorism, cyberattacks or nuclear weapons.

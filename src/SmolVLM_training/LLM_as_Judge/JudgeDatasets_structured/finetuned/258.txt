**Paragraph 1:**

"The data reveals a clear trend of higher science knowledge among more educated Americans. Postgraduate degrees, college degrees, and some college education levels show significantly higher scores compared to those with less education or no college education at all."

**Paragraph 2:**

"For example, postgraduate degrees show the highest scores, with 9.1 correct answers out of 11, followed by college degrees at 8.5 correct answers. Those with some college education also score 6.8 correct answers, while those with a high school diploma or less score 5.0 correct answers."

**Paragraph 3:**

"Interestingly, men consistently score higher than women, with 7.4 correct answers compared to 6.0 correct answers for women.

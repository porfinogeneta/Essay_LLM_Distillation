 1. <Describe a graph>:
"The bar chart illustrates the gross output of U.S. machine tool manufacturing from 2008 to 2018, measured in billion U.S. dollars."

2. <Find the key points, compare data>:

Paragraph 1:
"In 2008, the gross output of U.S. machine tool manufacturing was at its highest, reaching 7.2 billion U.S. dollars. This figure has since decreased, with the lowest output recorded in 2010 at 5.4 billion U.S. dollars. However, the gross output has gradually increased since then, reaching 7.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2018."

Paragraph 2:
"The overall trend shows a slight upward trajectory, with the gross output increasing from 7.2 billion dollars in 2008 to 7.9 billion dollars in 2018. The most significant increase occurred between 2010 and 2011, where the gross output rose from 5.4 billion dollars to 7.1 billion dollars. This indicates a recovery in the manufacturing sector after the initial decline."

3. <Write a summary of presented data>:
"Overall, the gross output of U.S. machine tool manufacturing has shown a positive trend, with a slight increase from 2008 to 2018. Despite the initial decline in 2010, the gross output has recovered and increased, indicating a rebound in the manufacturing sector."

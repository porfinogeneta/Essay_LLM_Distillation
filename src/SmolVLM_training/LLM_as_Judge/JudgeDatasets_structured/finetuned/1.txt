 The chart shows the projected change in the working-age population (ages 25 to 64) in the United States from 2015 to 2035, with and without future immigration.

**Key Findings:**

- **Without Future Immigrants:**
  - The working-age population is projected to decrease by 2035, from 183 million in 2015 to 166 million.
  - This decline is more pronounced without immigration, with a decrease from 118 million in 2015 to 86 million in 2035.

- **With Future Immigrants:**
  - The working-age population is projected to increase by 2035, from 183 million in 2015 to 166 million.
  - This increase is more modest with immigration, with a rise from 118 million in 2015 to 138 million in 2035.

**Trends:**

- **Increase Without Immigration:**
  - The working-age population has been steadily increasing without immigration from 1965 to 2015, with a notable rise from 86 million in 1965 to 118 million in 2015.

- **Increase With Immigration:**
  - The working-age population has also been increasing with immigration, but at a slower rate. From 1965 to 2015, the population increased from 86 million to 118 million, with a more significant rise from 118 million in 2015 to 138 million in 2035.

**Implications:**

- **Population Decline Without Immigration:**
  - The most significant impact of immigration on the working-age population is the reduction in the number of people without immigration.
  - This decline is particularly pronounced in the future, with the working-age population projected to decrease by 2035 without immigration.

- **Population Increase With Immigration:**
  - Immigration has contributed to a modest increase in the working-age population, but the increase is less pronounced compared to the increase without immigration.
  - This increase is more noticeable in the future, with the population projected to increase from 118 million in 2015 to 138 million in 2035.

Overall, the chart highlights the contrasting impacts of immigration on the working-age population in the United States, with immigration playing a more significant role in maintaining the population in the future without immigration.

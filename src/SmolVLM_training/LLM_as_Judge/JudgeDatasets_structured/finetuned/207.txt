The data reveals a significant decline in the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. in recent years, particularly in 2018. The sharpest decline is observed in fiscal year 2018, with only 15,000 refugees admitted, the lowest number in the provided data. This trend is consistent with the overall decline in refugee admissions over the past decade.

**Paragraph 2:**

The data highlights the impact of various factors, including political and economic conditions, on refugee admissions. The sharp decline in 2018 could be attributed to several factors, such as the Trump administration's restrictive policies, the ongoing global refugee crisis, and the economic downturn in many countries of origin.

**Paragraph 3:**

The data also indicates a gradual decline in refugee admissions over the years, with the exception of a brief increase in the mid-1990s. This trend suggests a long-term downward trajectory in refugee admissions, possibly influenced by geopolitical events, economic conditions, and changes in immigration policies.

**Paragraph 4:**

Overall, the data points to a significant decrease in refugee admissions to the U.S. in recent years, with the most notable decline in 2018. This trend is likely influenced by a combination of political and economic factors, as well as the ongoing global refugee crisis.

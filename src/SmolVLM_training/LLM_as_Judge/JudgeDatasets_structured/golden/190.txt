Paragraph 1:
"The majority of multiracial adults, 59%, felt that their background made them more open to other cultures. Additionally, 55% reported that it gave them a better understanding of people from different racial backgrounds. A smaller proportion, 19%, felt like a 'bridge' between different racial groups."

Paragraph 2:
"The data indicates a significant level of cultural openness and understanding among multiracial adults, with nearly six in ten feeling more open to other cultures and over half feeling more understanding of people from different racial backgrounds. However, fewer than one in five saw themselves as a 'bridge' between different racial groups, suggesting that while there is a strong sense of openness and understanding, the perception of acting as a mediator between groups is less prevalent."

However, the perception of acting as a 'bridge' between different racial groups is less common, indicating that while personal attitudes are positively influenced, the role of mediator is not as widely embraced."

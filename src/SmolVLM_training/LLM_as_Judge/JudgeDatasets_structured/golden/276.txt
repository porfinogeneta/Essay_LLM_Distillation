Rotterdam (NL) follows with 7 ATMs, while Brussels (BE) and Antwerp (BE) have 5 and 4 installations respectively. Other cities such as Enschede (NL), Maastricht (NL), and Ghent (BE) have relatively fewer ATMs, ranging from 2 to 4 installations."

Paragraph 2:
"Smaller cities in both countries exhibit minimal installations, with most cities having only 1 Bitcoin ATM. These include Alkmaar (NL), Eindhoven (NL), Bastogne (BE), Kortrijk (BE), and several others. The data suggests a concentration of Bitcoin ATMs in larger, more populous cities, while smaller cities have yet to see significant adoption."

"Overall, the data indicates a higher concentration of Bitcoin ATMs in the Netherlands compared to Belgium. Amsterdam stands out as the primary hub for Bitcoin ATMs, followed by Rotterdam. In Belgium, Brussels and Antwerp lead the way, but the overall numbers are lower.

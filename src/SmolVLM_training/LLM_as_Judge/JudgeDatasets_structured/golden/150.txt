1. Graph description:
The graph illustrates the changes in the population of India and China from the year 2000 with projected figures up to 2050.

2. Key points and trends:

Paragraph 1:
In 2000, China's population was approximately 1.25 billion, experiencing a steady increase to reach around 1.35 billion by the present day. The data suggests that this growth will peak at 1.45 billion in 2025, after which it is expected to decline gradually, reaching approximately 1.4 billion by 2050.

Paragraph 2:
Conversely, India's population began at one billion in 2000 and has been rising rapidly, currently standing at just under 1.25 billion. The projections indicate a continuous upward trend, with India’s population anticipated to surpass China’s by 2030 and eventually reaching a peak of 1.6 billion by 2050.

3. Summary of presented data:
Overall, the primary distinction between the population trends of India and China is that while China's population is expected to decline post-2030, India's population will continue to grow, ultimately overtaking China in terms of population size.

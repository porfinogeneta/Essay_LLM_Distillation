2. <Find the key points, trends and compare data>:

Paragraph 1:
"The majority of U.S. students opted for short-term study abroad programs, with 64.9% choosing this duration. This preference indicates a trend towards shorter, more intensive educational experiences overseas."

Paragraph 2:
"Conversely, only 2.2% of students chose long-term programs lasting one year. This significantly lower percentage suggests that extended stays abroad are less popular, possibly due to factors such as cost, time commitment, or personal circumstances."

Paragraph 3:
"Mid-length programs, lasting one or two terms, were chosen by 32.9% of students. This middle-ground option provides a balance between the immersive experience of long-term study and the brevity of short-term programs."

3. <Write a summary of presented data>:
"Overall, the data reveals a clear preference among U.S. students for short-term study abroad programs, with a notable minority opting for mid-length durations and a very small percentage choosing long-term stays.

1. <Describe a graph:>
"The graph provides data on the population growth in China and India from 2000 to 2050, with projections beyond 2020."

2. <Find the key points and trends:>

Paragraph 1:
"In 2000, China's population was approximately 1.25 billion, gradually increasing to around 1.35 billion by 2020. The projections indicate a peak at 1.45 billion around 2030, followed by a gradual decline to 1.4 billion by 2050."

Paragraph 2:
"In contrast, India's population started at one billion in 2000 and has been rising steadily, reaching nearly 1.25 billion by 2020. The trend suggests that India's population will continue to grow, surpassing China's around 2030 and reaching an estimated 1.6 billion by 2050."

3. <Write a summary of presented data:>
"The key difference between the two trends is that China's population is expected to decline post-2030, whereas India's population will keep increasing, indicating a significant demographic shift."

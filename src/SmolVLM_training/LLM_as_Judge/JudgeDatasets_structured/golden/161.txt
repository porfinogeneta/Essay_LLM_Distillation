1. <Describe a graph:>
"The graph illustrates the changes in the population of India and China from 2000 to 2050, with projections extending to 2050."

2. <Find the key points and trends:>

Paragraph 1:
"In 2000, China's population was approximately 1.25 billion, which increased gradually to about 1.35 billion by 2020. However, the graph predicts a peak in China's population around 2025 at 1.45 billion, followed by a gradual decline, reaching approximately 1.4 billion by 2050."

Paragraph 2:
"In contrast, India's population in 2000 was around one billion and has been rising steadily, reaching just under 1.25 billion by 2020. The projections indicate that India's population will continue to grow, surpassing China's around 2030 and reaching a peak of approximately 1.6 billion by 2050."

3. <Write a summary of presented data:>
"Overall, the graph highlights a significant demographic shift, with India's population expected to grow continuously, while China's population is projected to decline after 2025. This trend underscores the differing demographic trajectories of the two most populous countries in the world."

Paragraph 1: 
"In January, sales of bread were valued at $80,000 but this figure fell to around $45,000 in March and fluctuated between $40,000 and $65,000 until September. The last quarter, however, saw a jump in the value of bread sales to finish where it was at the beginning of the year."

Paragraph 2: 
"The sales of buns followed quite a different pattern. In January, bun sales stood at $40,000 but quickly rose to $70,000 in May and remained stable until August, after which they plunged to just $30,000 in December."

Paragraph 3:
"The sales of buns followed quite a different pattern. In January, bun sales stood at $40,000 but quickly rose to $70,000 in May and remained stable until August, after which they plunged to just $30,000 in December."

3. <Write a summary of presented data:>
"The value of pies sold slowly increased from $10,000 in January to reach $20,000 in August. Sales then levelled off but went up sharply in the last two months of the year to close just ahead of buns at $40,000. Pies were the only item where sales figures in December exceeded those in January."

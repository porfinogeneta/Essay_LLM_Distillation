Luxembourg : Gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita in current prices from 1985 to 2025  ( in U.S. dollars )

1. **Graph description:**
   The graph illustrates the changes in the population of India and China from 2000 to 2050, with data sourced from the United Nations Population Division.

2. **Body paragraphs:**

   **Paragraph 1:**
   In 2000, China's population was approximately 1.25 billion, slightly higher than India's 1 billion. China's population grew steadily, peaking at around 1.45 billion in 2030. However, it is projected to decline gradually, reaching approximately 1.4 billion by 2050. This decline is attributed to China's aging population and lower birth rates.

   **Paragraph 2:**
   In contrast, India's population has been on a continuous upward trajectory. Starting at 1 billion in 2000, it is expected to surpass China's population around 2030. By 2050, India's population is projected to reach 1.6 billion, driven by higher birth rates and a younger demographic.

3. **Overview of the data:**
   Overall, while China's population is expected to decline after 2030, India's population will continue to grow, making it the most populous country by 2050. This demographic shift will have significant implications for both countries' economic and social landscapes.
